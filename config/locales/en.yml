    h1: About the Grampian Spider Group
    p1: The current Grampian Spider Group was formed following a spider identification training course run by local spider expert Mike Davidson in 2007.
    p2: Since then, the group has been organising regular field survey events all around the Grampian area.
    p3: In 2009, the group began surveying locally designated conservation sites at the request of Aberdeenshire Council.
    p4: In 2011, the Grampian Spider Group also began to hold regular microscope ID workshops at the University of Aberdeen. Helping people to learn the practical skills needed to identify the species of a spider.
    p5: All our events are open to all abilities. In short, you may not need to bring much more than yourself, a note pad and pencil.
    p6: For field events, you will also need appropriate outdoor clothing and footwear. In addition, books on spider identification, bug-viewing pots, a hand lens and a pooter are always useful.
    p7: For microscope ID workshops, equipment is supplied by the university but as good lighting is essential it may be useful to bring along any LED torches for extra. There will be plenty of sample spiders for you to look at but you are also encouraged to bring along your own specimens for identification.
    p8: Many spiders are best identified in alcohol under a microscope. We are more than happy to take any samples which are collected during field excursions for formal identification and recording and then to return them to you at a later date.

    h1: Grampian Spider Group
    p1: The Grampian Spider Group is a group of local spider enthusiasts dedicated to learning more about our 8-legged friends. We regularly go on field surveys to collect species records that help create a better understanding of the abundance and distribution of spider populations in the Grampian area. We also hold regular workshops to help develop skills in identifying species.
    p2: Please sign in to view events and create records.

    p3: PS we are also quite keen on harvestmen
    p4: Our activities are carried out in support of the British Arachnological Society
